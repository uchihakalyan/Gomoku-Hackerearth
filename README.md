# Gomoku-Hackerearth

Gomoku is a two-player board game which is played on a 
10
X
10
10X10 grid of cells. Each player has an allocated color, Black ( First Player ) or White ( Second Player ) being conventional. Players take turns placing a stone of their color on a single cell within the overall playing board. The goal is to get an unbroken row of five or more stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Now here is the twist. We modified some of the rules of Gomoku to make the game little more interesting.

First Player must get an unbroken row of exactly five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. Any move which is creating an unbroken row of more than five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally is considered as Invalid Move.
The above rule is applied only to Black stone ( First Player ).
We will play it on an

10X10 grid simulated as rhombus.
